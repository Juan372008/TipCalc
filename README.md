# Tip Calculator

This repository was created to practice coding in Swift with [@japonte21](https://github.com/japonte21/) in the goal of making and developing an iOS application. In this case, the application is a tip calculator, in which the user is able to input the total on a purchase they've made and figure out what they should tip and what their peers should tip (provided everyone wants to chip in evenly)!

This project's sole purpose is getting a grasp on the Swift language and better understanding iOS app development in Xcode while creating a collaborative coding environment with git between engineers. If cloned, this project's constraints work with iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, and iPhone 11 Pro Max.
